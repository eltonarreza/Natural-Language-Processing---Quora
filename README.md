In this repository I analyse some questions asked on quora and use topic modeling with LDA to find out the topics, word embedding to find some relationships among the words and clustering to see whether the data can be divided into groups with similar characteristics.

The dataset used for the analysis is too big for github. You can find it on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data. You need a kaggle account to download it though.
